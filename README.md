# Digital-Clock-Using-FPGA-Board
Designed a Digital Clock using Verilog HDL and implemented it on an FPGA board. The design includes clock divider, counters for hours, minutes, and seconds, and a 7-segment display decoder. Verified functionality through simulation and hardware testing. This project improved my RTL design and FPGA implementation skills.
